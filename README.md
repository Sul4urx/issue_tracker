# Issue tracker

This repository is for bug reports and suggestions.

Just go to "Issues" and then select "New issue", select the template and then the rest is up to you.

If you can't report it here, you can also report issues in [my discord server](https://discord.com/invite/7W5mC7Yeaq), and I'll recreate it for you here!

**_Note:_ Do not include any other info that is not related to the issue or Minecraft.**
This includes PC specs, Windows' version, IP address etc.
